## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to gain further information regarding temperature trends before opening the shop. Specifically, temperature trends for the months June and December were requested, to see if the business can be sustainable during year-round. 

## Results

Comparing the [June statistics](./images/june_stats.png) and the [December statistics](./images/dec_stats.png), the descriptive statistics are higher in June compared to December, as summer typically has warmer weather compared to winter.

## Summary

Looking at the temperatures, it seems relatively safe to have the business open year-round, as the descriptive statistics look to be relatively similar, with December's numbers being lower. There are two queries that can be done to be more specific in checking weather trends.
* One suggestion would be doing a query based on overall precipitation, comparing June and December. This would help determine weather behaviours to see if the business would be sustainable year-round.
* Another suggestion would be doing a query based on year; in other words, comparing June and December within the same year. This could help show if temperature patterns can be consistent within the same year, showing if the business can be sustainable year-round.
